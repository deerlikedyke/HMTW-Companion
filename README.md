# HMTW-Companion
An <a href="https://github.com/GiovanH/unofficial-homestuck-collection">Unofficial Homestuck Collection</a> mod for listeners of <a href="http://rangedtouch.com/homestuck-made-this-world/">*Homestuck Made This World*</a>, "a podcast about the critical analysis and contextualization of the webcomic Homestuck" by Michael Lutz and Cameron Kunzelman of the Ranged Touch podcast network.

### Installation and Usage
To install the mod just download HMTWCompanion.js, drop it in the ```mods``` folder of your UHC asset pack, and enable it in the settings.

To follow along with the podcast as intended you only need to enable New Reader mode, set it to Page 1, and start reading! The end of each episode —I mean *partisode*— will be flagged in the narrative text itself.
